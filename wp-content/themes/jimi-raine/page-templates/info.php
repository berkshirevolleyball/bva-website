				<h4>How does Paycircle work?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Paycircle sits between you and your agencies and makes sure that the money that each agency pays has tax properly calculated on it at the moment at which you accept each booking.</p>
					<p>Then Paycircle works out your potential travel costs (and other things like meal allowances) and makes sure that each part of your pay goes in the correct pot and gets dealt with properly on payday.</p>
					<p>This makes sure that you don’t overpay tax each month. If you get paid by more than one agency each month, Paycircle can help balance out your tax payments as if you had one single employer and pay the overall correct amount of tax to HMRC.</p>
					<p>Until now no one, not even HMRC, has been able to do this properly! All this can be good for the agency because it’s good for you.</p>
