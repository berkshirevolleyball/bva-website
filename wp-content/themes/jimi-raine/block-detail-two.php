				<p>You may not be entitled to extra tax savings. It all depends on the work you do. In this case Paycircle works in the background and sorts your pay as normal.</p>

				<p>Either way you're never worse off.</p>

				<p>Some people manage their taxes manually, which is great! Now that Tax Tracker can take on the burden you can spend that time working or having fun!</p>
